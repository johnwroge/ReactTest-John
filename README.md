# ReactTest
This is a intermidate level aptitude test on React skills and web development knowledge. Using React, pull in post data from the dummy API, and display it on the page with the ability to text search and filter dynamically based on the incoming data. You should use React with hooks, rather than class components.

# Specifications

### Ticket 001
Pull in the posts from the API, and display cards for each post. The post card should display: image, text, owner (firstName, lastName, picture). The card should also link out to the provided link on the model.


### Ticket 002
Add a search bar that filters the results based on regular expressions. Additionally, add filters for each property of the post to filter the result from refinement lists.

# API End point
